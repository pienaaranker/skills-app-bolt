# Design and Technical Guidelines

Follow these guidelines when generating designs and writing code:

*   **Design Quality:** Aim for beautiful, unique designs suitable for production, not generic templates. Ensure webpages are fully featured.
*   **Client Components:** Always add the `"use client"` directive at the top of any file using client-side hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) when Next.js might treat it as a Server Component.
*   **Avoid Hydration Errors:** Do not write code that triggers the "Warning: Extra attributes from the server" error (e.g., mismatched `class` or `style` attributes).
*   **Core Libraries:** Utilize the existing stack: JSX with Tailwind CSS, `shadcn/ui`, React hooks, and `lucide-react` for icons. Avoid installing other UI/icon libraries unless specifically requested or essential.
*   **Icons:** Use icons exclusively from `lucide-react`. Use them for logos where appropriate.
*   **Stock Photos:** Use valid stock photo URLs from Pexels when needed. Embed them using `<img>` tags; do not download the images locally.
